> 🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧

## Overview
The Surface module allows admins to **control the visibility of UI containers** on a per-user or global basis.

## Current Features

- Show **global** (all users) and **user-specific** rules.
- Inline deletion of individual rules via the modal.
- Rule creation via container hover interface.
- Display creator and creation date for audit purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Real-time Rule Application** – Apply rules without page reload
- [ ] **Batch Operations** – Delete multiple rules at once
- [ ] **Rule Editing** – Edit existing rules instead of delete + recreate
- [ ] **Preview Mode** – See what container looks like when hidden
- [ ] **Rule History** – Track when rules were created/deleted
